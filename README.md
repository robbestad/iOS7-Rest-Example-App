iOS7 Rest Example App
=================

Consumes a REST API in iOS7 and populates a table view with the results


How to use
=================
Change the defined url to the API of your choice and run. On load, the app will automatically populate the table view with the titles from the API fetch request.

This is meant to be used as a starting point for making an APP based on fetching data from APIs, but could also be used as a simple tutorial on how to fetch data asynchronously and populate when the data is ready.
